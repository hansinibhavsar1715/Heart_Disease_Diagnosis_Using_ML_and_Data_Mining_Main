## **Heart Disease Diagnosis Using Machine Learning and Data Mining**

This project presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting the presence of heart disease using clinical patient data. The primary objective is to analyze medical attributes and build a predictive model capable of identifying individuals at potential risk of heart disease.

The project applies data mining and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful patterns from healthcare data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature evaluation, model training, and performance assessment. Multiple algorithms are explored to determine the most accurate and reliable predictive model.

By leveraging patient health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical parameters, the model aims to support early detection and assist in data-driven medical decision-making.
